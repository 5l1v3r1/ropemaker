# RopeMaker
An ESP8266 based machine for twisting suitable fibre into rope. It consists of up to 3 stepper 
motors and a small DC motor to control a mechanicism for twisting fibre. The user interface is web
based using a simple http server, with flash file system and JSON api calls all implemented in the 
ESP8266 device. Stepper control is via 3 DRV8825 modules that only require 1 or 2 control lines.

This project is incomplete due to a forced workshop move mid way. At this time the control electronics 
were breadboarded but a future step is to design a simple circuit board to hold the modules.

This code is provided for example only and with an MIT open source license.
